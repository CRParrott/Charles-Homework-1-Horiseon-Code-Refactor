Refractoring and organizing code.

This project was to fix and reorganize a code outline for a website.

The header was the hardest part at first, it work break the list down to bullet points whenever the window shrunk down. Once I was able to correct that the rest of the code was fairly simple to organize. The page links are all functioning and highlight while hovering over and the page now resizes properly.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
